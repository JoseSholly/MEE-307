# MEE 307 Project
## Numerical Analysis of Fluids in Horizontal and Vertical pipes

This project shows the development of a program which calculates from Fluid Density, Pipe diameter, Flow Velocity, Dynamic Viscosity, Pipe Roughness, Pipe Length, Conductivity and Specific Heat Capacity of Fluid to determine:
- Reynolds Number which determines the Flow Type (Laminar, Transitional or Turbulent Flow) 
- Head Loss
- Pressure Loss
- Co-efficient of Heat Transfer 

We have Horizontal and Vertical for practical class in file folder

The Windows Application was built with Python TKinter
